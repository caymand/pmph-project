Final group project for the PMPH course.

## Matrix multiplication on the tensor core
We implement matrix multiplication using tensor cores.
On an A100 Nvidia GPU we achieve 81TFLOPS peak performance. 

## Tiling strategy
See our report in the docs for implementation details such as tiling strategy.
